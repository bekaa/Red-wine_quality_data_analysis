# predicting red wine quality

Red wine is one of the most beautiful drinks, so itâ€™s going to be interesting to find out what makes a good wine ! :)
using the published dataset for red-wine quality, I'm Investigating the dataset using R and exploratory data analysis techniques, exploring both single variables and relationships between variables.  
The data-set contains 11 chemical characteristics beside a quality graded from at least 3 wine experts for 1599 different wines.  
Predicting the quality using R.  
This project is a part of the data-analysis Nanodegree provided by udacity.  

The project is published on RPubs from this link : http://rpubs.com/beka/red-wine_data-analysis .  
And you can find the source R code under the name : project.Rmd .  
And the output html file : project.html.      
 
The folder ./Data contains the data-set.  
The folde ./images contains some images I used in the code.  
And some other small R script files I also used in the code.
