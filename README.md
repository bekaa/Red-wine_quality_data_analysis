# Red-wine_quality_data_analysis

Red wine is one of the most beautiful drinks, so it’s going to be interesting to find out what makes a good wine ! :)

This is a Data analysis for the red-wine data-set.  

The project is published on shinyapp from this link : https://bekaa.shinyapps.io/red-wine_data-analysis ,  
also on RPubs from this link : http://rpubs.com/beka/red-wine_data-analysis
And you can find the source of the RPub version under the name : project-html.Rmd , and it's html file : project-html.html.    
And The source for the shinyapp version under the name project-shiny.Rmd.    
There is no big difference between the two versions except the way I represented some plots.  
The folder Data contains the data-set.  
The folde images contains some images I used in the code.  
And some other small R script files I also used in the code.
